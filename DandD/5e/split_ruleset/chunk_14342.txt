A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the *Player’s Handbook.*
 
 A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).
 
 A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.
 
 #### Hit Dice by Size
 
 | Monster Size | Hit Die | Average HP per Die |
 |--------------|---------|--------------------|
 | Tiny         | d4      | 2½                 |
 | Small        | d6      | 3½                 |
 | Medium       | d8      | 4½                 |
 | Large        | d10     | 5½                 |
 | Huge         | d12     | 6½                 |
 | Gargantuan   | d20     | 10½                |
 
 
 A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).
 
 ### Speed
 
 A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the *Player’s Handbook.*
 
 All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.
 
 Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.
 
 #### Burrow
 
 A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.
 
 #### Climb
 
 A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.
 
 #### Fly
 
 A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to **hover**, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the *Player’s Handbook*). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.
 
 #### Swim
 
 A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.
 
 ### Ability Scores
 
 Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used in play, see the *Player’s Handbook.*
 
 ### Saving Throws
 
 The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.
 
 A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).
 
 #### Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating
 
 
 | Challenge | Proficiency Bonus |
 |-----------|-------------------|
 | 0         | +2                |
 | 1/8       | +2                |
 | 1/4       | +2                |
 | 1/2       | +2                |

 | 30        | +9                |
 
 ### Skills
 
 The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
 
 A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.
