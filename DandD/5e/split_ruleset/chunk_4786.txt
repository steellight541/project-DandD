Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.
 
 Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.
 
 ### Being Prone
 
 Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.
 
 You can **drop prone** without using any of your speed. **Standing up** takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend
 
 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.
 
 To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.
 
 ### Moving Around Other Creatures
 
 You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.
 
 Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.
 
 If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.
 
 ### Flying Movement
 
 Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the *fly* spell.
 
 ### Creature Size
 
 Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.
 
 #### Size Categories
 
 | Size       | Space                  |
 |------------|------------------------|
 | Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ ft.           |
 | Small      | 5 by 5 ft.             |
 | Medium     | 5 by 5 ft.             |
 | Large      | 10 by 10 ft.           |
 | Huge       | 15 by 15 ft.           |
 | Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger |
 
 #### Space
 
 A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5- foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.
 
 A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.
 
 Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.
 
 #### Squeezing into a Smaller Space
 
 A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.
 
 ### Interacting with Objects Around You
 
 Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:
 - draw or sheathe a sword
 - open or close a door
 - withdraw a potion from your backpack
 - pick up a dropped axe
 - take a bauble from a table
 - remove a ring from your finger
 - stuff some food into your mouth
 - plant a banner in the ground
 - fish a few coins from your belt pouch
 - drink all the ale in a flagon
 - throw a lever or a switch
 - pull a torch from a sconce
 - take a book from a shelf you can reach
 - extinguish a small flame
 - don a mask
 - pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head
 - put your ear to a door
 - kick a small stone
 - turn a key in a lock
 - tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
 - hand an item to another character
 
 Actions in Combat
 -----------------
 
 When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.
 
 When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.
 
 ### Attack
 
 The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.
 
 With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.
 
 Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.
 
 ### Cast a Spell
 
 Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.
 
 ### Dash
 
 When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.
