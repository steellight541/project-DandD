 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
 
 The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
 
 #### Regenerate
 
 *7th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).
 
 The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.
 
 #### Reincarnate
 
 *5th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 hour
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.
 
 If the target’s soul isn’t free or willing to do so, the spell fails.
 
 The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature’s race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.
 
 | d100  | Race                |
 |-------|---------------------|
 | 01–04 | Dragonborn          |
 | 05–13 | Dwarf, hill         |
 | 14–21 | Dwarf, mountain     |
 | 22–25 | Elf, dark           |
 | 26–34 | Elf, high           |
 | 35–42 | Elf, wood           |
 | 43–46 | Gnome, forest       |
 | 47–52 | Gnome, rock         |
 | 53–56 | Half-elf            |
 | 57–60 | Half-orc            |
 | 61–68 | Halfling, lightfoot |
 | 69–76 | Halfling, stout     |
 | 77–96 | Human               |
 | 97–00 | Tiefling            |
 
 The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.
 
 #### Remove Curse
 
 *3rd-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner’s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
 
 #### Resilient Sphere
 
 *4th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.
 
 Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.
 
 The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.
 
 A *disintegrate* spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.
 
 #### Resistance
 
 *Abjuration cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
