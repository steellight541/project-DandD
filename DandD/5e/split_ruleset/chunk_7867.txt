Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.
 
 When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.
 
 #### Geas
 
 *5th-level enchantment*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** 30 days
 
 You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.
 
 You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.
 
 You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A *remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or *wish* spell also ends it.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.
 
 #### Gentle Repose
 
 *2nd-level necromancy (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse’s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)
 
 **Duration:** 10 days
 
 You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.
 
 The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit of spells such as *raise dead.*
 
 #### Giant Insect
 
 *4th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.
 
 Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.
 
 A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.
 
 The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.
 
 #### Glibness
 
 *8th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.
 
 #### Globe of Invulnerability
 
 *6th-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.
 
 Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.
 
 #### Glyph of Warding
 
 *3rd-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 hour
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)
