 #### Boots of Striding and Springing
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn’t reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three times the normal distance, though you can’t jump farther than your remaining movement would allow.
 
 #### Boots of the Winterlands
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 These furred boots are snug and feel quite warm. While you wear them, you gain the following benefits:
 - You have resistance to cold damage.
 - You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.
 - You can tolerate temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as −100 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
 #### Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals
 
 *Wondrous item, rare*
 
 While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl’s command word and summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the *conjure elemental* spell. The bowl can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
 
 The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
 
 #### Bracers of Archery
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing these bracers, you have proficiency with the longbow and shortbow, and you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls on ranged attacks made with such weapons.
 
 #### Bracers of Defense
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing these bracers, you gain a +2 bonus to AC if you are wearing no armor and using no shield.
 
 #### Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals
 
 *Wondrous item, rare*
 
 While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak the brazier’s command word and summon a fire elemental, as if you had cast the *conjure elemental* spell. The brazier can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
 
 The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
 
 #### Brooch of Shielding
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this brooch, you have resistance to force damage, and you have immunity to damage from the *magic missile* spell.
 
 #### Broom of Flying
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.
 
 You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.
 
 #### Candle of Invocation
 
 *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity’s alignment. The candle’s alignment can be detected with the *detect evil and good* spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.
 
 | d20   | Alignment       |
 |-------|-----------------|
 | 1–2   | Chaotic evil    |
 | 3–4   | Chaotic neutral |
 | 5–7   | Chaotic good    |
 | 8–9   | Neutral evil    |
 | 10–11 | Neutral         |
 | 12–13 | Neutral good    |
 | 14–15 | Lawful evil     |
 | 16–17 | Lawful neutral  |
 | 18–20 | Lawful good     |
 
 The candle’s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle’s total burn time.
 
 While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle’s can cast 1st- level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell’s effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.
 
 Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the *gate* spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.
 
 #### Cape of the Mountebank
 
 *Wondrous item, rare*
 
 This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the *dimension door* spell as an action. This property of the cape can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 
 When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.
 
 #### Carpet of Flying
 
 *Wondrous item, very rare*
 
 You can speak the carpet’s command word as an action to make the carpet hover and fly. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of it.
 
 Four sizes of *carpet of flying* exist. The GM chooses the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly.
