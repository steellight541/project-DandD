**Components:** V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere’s area is difficult terrain.
 
 When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.
 
 #### Instant Summons
 
 *6th-level conjuration (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000 gp)
 
 **Duration:** Until dispelled
 
 You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.
 
 At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item’s name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.
 
 If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.
 
 *Dispel magic* or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this spell’s effect.
 
 #### Invisibility
 
 *2nd-level illusion*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
 
 A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
 
 #### Irresistible Dance
 
 *6th-level enchantment*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this spell.
 
 A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.
 
 #### Jump
 
 *1st-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a grasshopper’s hind leg)
 
 **Duration:** 1 minute
 
 You touch a creature. The creature’s jump distance is tripled until the spell ends.
 
 #### Knock
 
 *2nd-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.
 
 A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.
 
 If you choose a target that is held shut with *arcane lock*, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.
 
 When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.
 
 #### Legend Lore
 
 *5th-level divination*
 
 **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
