**Damage Immunities** psychic; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks
 
 **Senses** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 15
 
 **Languages** all, telepathy 120 ft.
 
 **Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP)
 
 ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The couatl’s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:
 
 At will: *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*, *detect thoughts*
 3/day each: *bless*, *create food and water*, *cure wounds*, *lesser restoration*, *protection from poison*, *sanctuary*, *shield*
 1/day each: *dream*, *greater restoration*, *scrying*
 
 ***Magic Weapons.*** The couatl’s weapon attacks are magical.
 
 ***Shielded Mind.*** The couatl is immune to scrying and to any effect that would sense its emotions, read its thoughts, or detect its location.
 
 **Actions**
 
 ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. Until this poison ends, the target is unconscious. Another creature can use an action to shake the target awake.
 
 ***Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the couatl can’t constrict another target.
 
 ***Change Shape.*** The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl’s choice).
 
 In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that form.
 
 Monsters (D)

 #### Darkmantle
 
 *Small monstrosity, unaligned*
 
 **Armor Class** 11
 
 **Hit Points** 22 (5d6 + 5)
 
 **Speed** 10 ft., fly 30 ft.
 
 | STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |
 |---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|

 **Languages** —
 
 **Challenge** 1/2 (100 XP)
 
 ***Echolocation.*** The darkmantle can’t use its blindsight while deafened.
 
 ***False Appearance.*** While the darkmantle remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a cave formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite.
 
 **Actions**
 
 ***Crush.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target’s head, and the target is also blinded and unable to breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way.
 
 While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle’s speed also becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.
 
 A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.
 
 ***Darkness Aura (1/Day).*** A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can’t penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

 ***Death Throes.*** When the balor dies, it explodes, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren’t being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor’s weapons.
 
 ***Fire Aura.*** At the start of each of the balor’s turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren’t being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.
