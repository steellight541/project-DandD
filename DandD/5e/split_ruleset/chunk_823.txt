 When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
 
 Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.
 
 Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel
 
 Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
 
 #### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
 
 As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
 
 A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
 
 ### Ability Score Improvement
 
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
 
 ### Destroy Undead
 
 Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.
 
 #### Destroy Undead
 
 | Cleric Level | Destroys Undead of CR... |
 |--------------|--------------------------|
 | 5th          | 1/2 or lower             |
 | 8th          | 1 or lower               |
 | 11th         | 2 or lower               |
 | 14th         | 3 or lower               |
 | 17th         | 4 or lower               |
 
 ### Divine Intervention
 
 Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
 
 Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.
 
 If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
 
 At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
 
 ### Life Domain
 
 The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).
 
 #### Life Domain Spells
 
 | Cleric Level | Spells                               |
 |--------------|--------------------------------------|
 | 1st          | bless, cure wounds                   |
 | 3rd          | lesser restoration, spiritual weapon |
 | 5th          | beacon of hope, revivify             |
 | 7th          | death ward, guardian of faith        |
 | 9th          | mass cure wounds, raise dead         |
 
 #### Bonus Proficiency
 
 When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.
 
 #### Disciple of Life
 
 Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
 
 #### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life
 
 Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.
 
 As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.
 
 #### Blessed Healer
 
 Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
 
 #### Divine Strike
 
 At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
 
 #### Supreme Healing
 
 Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
