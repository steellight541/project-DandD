This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
 
 An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.
 
 | d10  | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                        |
 |------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | 1    | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn. |
 | 2–6  | The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.                                                                                                                                            |
 | 7–8  | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.     |
 | 9–10 | The creature can act and move normally.                                                                                                                                                         |
 
 At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
