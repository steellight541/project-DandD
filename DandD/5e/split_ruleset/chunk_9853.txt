Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
 
 Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
 
 #### Reverse Gravity
 
 *7th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 100 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100- foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.
 
 If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.
 
 At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.
 
 #### Revivify
 
 *3rd-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.
 
 #### Rope Trick
 
 *2nd-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.
 
 The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.
 
 Attacks and spells can’t cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5- foot window centered on the rope.
 
 Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.
 
 #### Sacred Flame
 
 *Evocation cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.
 
 The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
 
 #### Sanctuary
 
 *1st-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a small silver mirror)
 
 **Duration:** 1 minute
 
 You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.
 
 If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.
 
 #### Scorching Ray
 
 *2nd-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.
