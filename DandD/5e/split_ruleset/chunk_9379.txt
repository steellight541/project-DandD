 This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.
 
 If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.
 
 You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area from being affected.
 
 If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
 
 #### Polymorph
 
 *4th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
 
 This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
 
 The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.
 
 The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.
 
 The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
 
 The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
 
 #### Power Word Kill
 
 *9th-level enchantment*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.
 
 #### Power Word Stun
 
 *8th-level enchantment*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.
 
 The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
 
 #### Prayer of Healing
 
 *2nd-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
 
 **Range:** 30 feet

 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
 
 #### Prestidigitation

 - You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
