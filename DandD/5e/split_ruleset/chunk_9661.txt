 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.
 
 For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.
 
 #### Purify Food and Drink
 
 *1st-level transmutation (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 10 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 All nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease.
 
 #### Raise Dead
 
 *5th-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 hour
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
 
 This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead creature to life.
 
 This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
 
 Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
 
 #### Ray of Enfeeblement
 
 *2nd-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the spell ends.
 
 At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.
 
 #### Ray of Frost
 
 *Evocation cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
 
 The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
 
 #### Regenerate
 
 *7th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).
 
 The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.
 
 #### Reincarnate
 
 *5th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 hour
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
