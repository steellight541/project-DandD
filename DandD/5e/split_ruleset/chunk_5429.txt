 Spell Descriptions
 ------------------
 
 #### Acid Arrow
 
 *2nd-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 90 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder’s stomach)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.
