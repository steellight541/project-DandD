#### Guards and Wards
 
 *6th-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)
 
 **Duration:** 24 hours
 
 You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.
 
 When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
 
 *Guards and wards* creates the following effects within the warded area.
 
 ***Corridors.*** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.
 
 ***Doors.*** All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an *arcane lock* spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the *minor illusion* spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
 
 ***Stairs.*** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the *web* spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while *guards and wards* lasts.
 
 ***Other Spell Effect.*** You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.
 - Place *dancing lights* in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as *guards and wards* lasts.
 - Place *magic mouth* in two locations.
 - Place *stinking cloud* in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while *guards and wards* lasts.
 - Place a constant *gust of wind* in one corridor or room.
 - Place a *suggestion* in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.
 
 The whole warded area radiates magic. A *dispel magic* cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.
 
 You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.
 
 #### Guidance
 
 *Divination cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.
 
 #### Guiding Bolt
 
 *1st-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** 1 round
 
 A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
 
 #### Gust of Wind
 
 *2nd-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self (60-foot line)
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a legume seed)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell’s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.
 
 Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.
 
 The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.
 
 As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.
 
 #### Hallow
 
 *5th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 24 hours
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Until dispelled
 
 You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a *hallow* spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.
 
 First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.
