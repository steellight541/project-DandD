 While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.
 
 You can use an action to cause the ring to become invisible until you use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.
 
 If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can’t prevent this telepathic communication.
 
 #### Ring of Protection
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while wearing this ring.
 
 #### Ring of Regeneration
 
 *Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you regain 1d6 hit points every 10 minutes, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after 1d6 + 1 days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
 
 #### Ring of Resistance
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 You have resistance to one damage type while wearing this ring. The gem in the ring indicates the type, which the GM chooses or determines randomly.

 | 2   | Cold        | Tourmaline |

 #### Ring of Shooting Stars
 
 *Ring, very rare (requires attunement outdoors at night)*
 
 While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast *dancing lights* and *light* from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.
 
 The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.
 
 ***Faerie Fire.*** You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast *faerie fire* from the ring.
 
 ***Ball Lightning.*** You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.
 
 Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.
 
 As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.
 
 | Spheres | Lightning Damage |
 |---------|------------------|
 | 4       | 2d4              |
 | 3       | 2d6              |
 | 2       | 5d4              |
 | 1       | 4d12             |
 
 ***Shooting Stars.*** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
 #### Ring of Spell Storing
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.
 
 Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
 
 While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
 
 #### Ring of Spell Turning
 
 *Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.
 
 #### Ring of Swimming
 
 *Ring, uncommon*
 
 You have a swimming speed of 40 feet while wearing this ring.
 
 #### Ring of Telekinesis
 
 *Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you can cast the *telekinesis* spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren’t being worn or carried.
 
 #### Ring of the Ram
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring produces a spectral ram’s head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.
 
 Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring’s charges as an action to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn’t being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.
 
 #### Ring of Three Wishes
