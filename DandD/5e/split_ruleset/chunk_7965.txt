**Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered
 
 When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
 
 The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
 
 You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
 
 You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
 
 When you inscribe the glyph, choose *explosive runes* or a *spell glyph.*
 
 ***Explosive Runes.*** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
 ***Spell Glyph.*** You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an *explosive runes* glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a *spell glyph*, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the *glyph of warding.*
 
 #### Grease
 
 *1st-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)
 
 **Duration:** 1 minute
 
 Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.
 
 When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
 
 #### Greater Invisibility
 
 *4th-level illusion*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person.
 
 #### Greater Restoration
 
 *5th-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect. You can reduce the target’s exhaustion level by one, or end one of the following effects on the target:
 - One effect that charmed or petrified the target
 - One curse, including the target’s attunement to a cursed magic item
 - Any reduction to one of the target’s ability scores
 - One effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum
 
 #### Guards and Wards
 
 *6th-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)
 
 **Duration:** 24 hours
 
 You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.
 
 When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
 
 *Guards and wards* creates the following effects within the warded area.
 
 ***Corridors.*** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.
 
 ***Doors.*** All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an *arcane lock* spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the *minor illusion* spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
 
 ***Stairs.*** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the *web* spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while *guards and wards* lasts.
 
 ***Other Spell Effect.*** You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.
 - Place *dancing lights* in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as *guards and wards* lasts.
 - Place *magic mouth* in two locations.
 - Place *stinking cloud* in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while *guards and wards* lasts.
 - Place a constant *gust of wind* in one corridor or room.
 - Place a *suggestion* in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.
