 ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
 
 At will: *detect magic*, *magic missile*
 2/day each: *plane shift* (self only), *ray of enfeeblement*, *sleep*
 
 ***Magic Resistance.*** The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
 
 ***Actions***
 
 ***Claws (Hag Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
 
 ***Change Shape.*** The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.
 
 ***Etherealness.*** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a *heartstone* in her possession.
 
 ***Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).*** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A *protection from evil and good* spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a *magic circle*. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag’s *soul bag*. The reduction to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until removed by the *greater restoration* spell or similar magic.
 
 ##### Sea Hag
 
 *Medium fey, chaotic evil*
 
 **Armor Class** 14 (natural armor)
 
 **Hit Points** 52 (7d8 + 21)
 
 **Speed** 30 ft., swim 40 ft.
 
 | STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |
 |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
 | 16 (+3) | 13 (+1) | 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 13 (+1) |
 
 **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11
 
 **Languages** Aquan, Common, Giant
 
 **Challenge** 2 (450 XP)
 
 ***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.
 
 ***Horrific Appearance.*** Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag’s true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag’s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.
 
 Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag’s true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.
 
 **Actions**
 
 ***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
 
 ***Death Glare.*** The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.
 
 ***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
 
 The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.
 
 #### Half-Dragon Template
 
 A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon. It keeps its statistics, except as follows.
 
 ***Challenge.*** To avoid recalculating the creature’s challenge rating, apply the template only to a creature that meets the optional prerequisite in the Breath Weapon table below. Otherwise, recalculate the rating after you apply the template.
 
 ***Senses.*** The half-dragon gains blindsight with a radius of 10 feet and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.
 
 ***Resistances.*** The half-dragon gains resistance to a type of damage based on its color.
 
 | Color               | Damage Resistance |
 |---------------------|-------------------|
 | Black or copper     | Acid              |
 | Blue or bronze      | Lightning         |
 | Brass, gold, or red | Fire              |
 | Green               | Poison            |
 | Silver or white     | Cold              |
 
 ***Languages.*** The half-dragon speaks Draconic in addition to any other languages it knows.
 
 ***New Action: Breath Weapon.*** The half-dragon has the breath weapon of its dragon half. The half- dragon’s size determines how this action functions.
