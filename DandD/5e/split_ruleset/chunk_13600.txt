 #### Rope of Climbing
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.
 
 If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1- foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.
 
 The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
 
 #### Rope of Entanglement
 
 *Wondrous item, rare*
 
 This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.
 
 You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.
 
 The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
 
 #### Scarab of Protection
 
 *Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*
 
 If you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:
 - You have advantage on saving throws against spells.
 - The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.
 
 #### Scimitar of Speed
 
 *Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.
 
 #### Shield, +1, +2, or +3
 
 *Armor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)*
 
 While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield’s rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.
 
 #### Shield of Missile Attraction
 
 *Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.
 
 ***Curse.*** This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
 
 #### Slippers of Spider Climbing
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.
 
 #### Sovereign Glue
 
 *Wondrous item, legendary*
 
 This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with *oil of slipperiness.* When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.
 
 One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of *universal solvent* or *oil of etherealness*, or with a *wish* spell.
 
 #### Spell Scroll
 
 *Scroll, varies*
 
 A *spell scroll* bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell’s components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.
 
 If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.
 
 The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

 | 9th         | Legendary | 19      | +11          |
 
 A wizard spell on a *spell scroll* can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the *spell scroll* is destroyed.
 
 
 #### Spellguard Shield
 
 *Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks have disadvantage against you.
 
 #### Sphere of Annihilation
 
 *Wondrous item, legendary*
