 ***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.
 
 #### Black Tentacles
 
 *4th-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 90 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
 
 When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.
 
 A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
 
 #### Blade Barrier
 
 *6th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 90 feet **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.
 
 When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
 
 #### Bless
 
 *1st-level enchantment*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
 
 #### Blight
 
 *4th-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
 
 If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.
 
 If you target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
 
 #### Blindness/Deafness
 
 *2nd-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components**: V
 
 **Duration:** 1 minute
 
 You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
 
 #### Blink
 
 *3rd-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** 1 minute
 
 Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.
 
 While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can’t see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren’t there can’t perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.
