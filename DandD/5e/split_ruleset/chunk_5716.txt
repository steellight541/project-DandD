A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.
 
 #### Arcane Eye
 
 *4th-level divination*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
 
 You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.
 
 You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.
 
 As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.
 
 #### Arcane Hand
 
 *5th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.
 
 The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space.
 
 When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.
 
 ***Clenched Fist.*** The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
 
 ***Forceful Hand.*** The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.
 
 Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.
 
 ***Grasping Hand.*** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
 
 ***Interposing Hand.*** The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.
 
 #### Arcane Lock
 
 *2nd-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Until dispelled
 
 You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting *knock* on the object suppresses *arcane lock* for 10 minutes.
 
 While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.
 
 #### Arcane Sword
 
 *7th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.
 
 When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.
 
 #### Arcanist’s Magic Aura
 
 *2nd-level illusion*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)
 
 **Duration:** 24 hours
 
 You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.
 
 When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.
 
 ***False Aura.*** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as *detect magic*, that detect magical auras*.* You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.
 
 ***Mask.*** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a *symbol* spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.
