***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
 
 The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.
 
 #### Half-Dragon Template
 
 A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon. It keeps its statistics, except as follows.
 
 ***Challenge.*** To avoid recalculating the creature’s challenge rating, apply the template only to a creature that meets the optional prerequisite in the Breath Weapon table below. Otherwise, recalculate the rating after you apply the template.
 
 ***Senses.*** The half-dragon gains blindsight with a radius of 10 feet and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.
 
 ***Resistances.*** The half-dragon gains resistance to a type of damage based on its color.
 
 | Color               | Damage Resistance |
 |---------------------|-------------------|
 | Black or copper     | Acid              |
 | Blue or bronze      | Lightning         |
 | Brass, gold, or red | Fire              |
 | Green               | Poison            |
 | Silver or white     | Cold              |
 
 ***Languages.*** The half-dragon speaks Draconic in addition to any other languages it knows.
 
 ***New Action: Breath Weapon.*** The half-dragon has the breath weapon of its dragon half. The half- dragon’s size determines how this action functions.
 
 | Size             | Breath Weapon      | Optional Prerequisite |
 |------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
 | Large or smaller | As a wyrmling      | Challenge 2 or higher |

 | Gargantuan       | As an adult dragon | Challenge 8 or higher |

 | 12 (+1) | 13 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 7 (−2) | 10 (+0) | 13 (+1) |
 
 **Senses** passive Perception 10

 ***Club.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.
 
 ***Luring Song.*** The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.
 
 While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.
 
 A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy’s song for the next 24 hours.
