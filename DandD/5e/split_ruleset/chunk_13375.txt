#### Ring of Shooting Stars
 
 *Ring, very rare (requires attunement outdoors at night)*
 
 While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast *dancing lights* and *light* from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.
 
 The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.
 
 ***Faerie Fire.*** You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast *faerie fire* from the ring.
 
 ***Ball Lightning.*** You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.
 
 Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.
 
 As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.
 
 | Spheres | Lightning Damage |
 |---------|------------------|
 | 4       | 2d4              |
 | 3       | 2d6              |
 | 2       | 5d4              |
 | 1       | 4d12             |
 
 ***Shooting Stars.*** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
 #### Ring of Spell Storing
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.
 
 Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
 
 While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
 
 #### Ring of Spell Turning
 
 *Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.
 
 #### Ring of Swimming
 
 *Ring, uncommon*
 
 You have a swimming speed of 40 feet while wearing this ring.
 
 #### Ring of Telekinesis
 
 *Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you can cast the *telekinesis* spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren’t being worn or carried.
 
 #### Ring of the Ram
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring produces a spectral ram’s head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.
 
 Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring’s charges as an action to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn’t being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.
 
 #### Ring of Three Wishes
 
 *Ring, legendary*
 
 While wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the *wish* spell from it. The ring becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge.
 
 #### Ring of Warmth
 
 *Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you have resistance to cold damage. In addition, you and everything you wear and carry are unharmed by temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
 #### Ring of Water Walking
 
 *Ring, uncommon*
 
 While wearing this ring, you can stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground.
 
 #### Ring of X-ray Vision
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.
 
 Whenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.
 
 #### Robe of Eyes
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:
 - The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
 - You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
 - You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.
 
 The eyes on the robe can’t be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.
 
 A *light* spell cast on the robe or a *daylight* spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for *light* or DC 15 for *daylight*), ending the blindness on a success.
