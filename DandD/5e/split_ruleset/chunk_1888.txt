 #### Spell Slots
 
 The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
 
 For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot.
 
 #### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
 
 You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.
 
 The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
 
 Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 
 #### Spellcasting Ability
 
 Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
 
 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
 
 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
 
 ### Ranger Archetype
 
 At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
 
 ### Primeval Awareness
 
 Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.
 
 ### Ability Score Improvement
 
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
 
 ### Extra Attack
 
 Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
 
 ### Land’s Stride
 
 Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
 
 In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell.
 
 ### Hide in Plain Sight
 
 Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.
 
 Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.
 
 ### Vanish
 
 Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
 
 ### Feral Senses
 
 At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.
 
 You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.
 
 ### Foe Slayer
 
 At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
 
 Ranger Archetypes
 -----------------
 
 The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master.
 
 ### Hunter
 
 Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.
 
 #### Hunter’s Prey
 
 At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
 
 ***Colossus Slayer.*** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.
 
 ***Giant Killer.*** When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
 
 ***Horde Breaker.*** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.
 
 #### Defensive Tactics
 
 At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
 
 ***Escape the Horde.*** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.
 
 ***Multiattack Defense.*** When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.
 
 ***Steel Will.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
 
 #### Multiattack
 
 At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
 
 ***Volley.*** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.
 
 ***Whirlwind Attack.*** You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.
