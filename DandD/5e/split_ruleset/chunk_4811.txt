 ### Creature Size
 
 Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.
 
 #### Size Categories
 
 | Size       | Space                  |
 |------------|------------------------|
 | Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ ft.           |
 | Small      | 5 by 5 ft.             |
 | Medium     | 5 by 5 ft.             |
 | Large      | 10 by 10 ft.           |
 | Huge       | 15 by 15 ft.           |
 | Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger |
 
 #### Space
 
 A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5- foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.
 
 A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.
 
 Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.
 
 #### Squeezing into a Smaller Space
 
 A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.
 
 ### Interacting with Objects Around You
 
 Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:
 - draw or sheathe a sword
 - open or close a door
 - withdraw a potion from your backpack
 - pick up a dropped axe
 - take a bauble from a table
 - remove a ring from your finger
 - stuff some food into your mouth
 - plant a banner in the ground
 - fish a few coins from your belt pouch
 - drink all the ale in a flagon
 - throw a lever or a switch
 - pull a torch from a sconce
 - take a book from a shelf you can reach
 - extinguish a small flame
 - don a mask
 - pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head
 - put your ear to a door
 - kick a small stone
 - turn a key in a lock
 - tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
 - hand an item to another character
 
 Actions in Combat
 -----------------
 
 When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.
 
 When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.
 
 ### Attack
 
 The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.
 
 With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.
 
 Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.
 
 ### Cast a Spell
 
 Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.
 
 ### Dash
 
 When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.
 
 Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.
 
 ### Disengage
 
 If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
 
 ### Dodge
 
 When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.
 
 ### Help
 
 You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.
 
 Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.
 
 ### Hide
 
 When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section later in this chapter.
 
 ### Ready
 
 Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.
 
 First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”
