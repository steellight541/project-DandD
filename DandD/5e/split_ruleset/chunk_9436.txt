 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.
 
 The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
 
 #### Prayer of Healing
 
 *2nd-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
 
 #### Prestidigitation
 
 *Transmutation cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 10 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Up to 1 hour
 
 This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
 - You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
 - You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
 - You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
 - You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
 - You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
 - You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.
 
 If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
 
 #### Prismatic Spray
 
 *7th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.
 
 1.  ***Red.*** The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 2.  ***Orange.*** The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 3.  ***Yellow.*** The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 4.  ***Green.*** The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 5.  ***Blue.*** The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 6.  ***Indigo.*** On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
 7.  ***Violet.*** On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
 8.  ***Special.*** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.
 
 #### Prismatic Wall
 
 *9th-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** 10 minutes
 
 A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.
 
 The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.
 
 The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.
 
 The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A *rod of cancellation* destroys a *prismatic wall*, but an *antimagic field* has no effect on it.
 
 1.  ***Red.*** The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
 2.  ***Orange.*** The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.
 3.  ***Yellow.*** The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.
 4.  ***Green.*** The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A *passwall* spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.
 5.  ***Blue.*** The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.
 6.  ***Indigo.*** On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a *daylight* spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.
 7.  ***Violet.*** On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a *dispel magic* spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.
