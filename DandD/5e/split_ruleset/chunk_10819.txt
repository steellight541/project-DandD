 **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.
 
 This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.

 #### True Seeing
 
 *6th-level divination*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.
 
 #### True Strike
 
 *Divination cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round
 
 You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target’s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn’t ended.
 
 #### Unseen Servant
 
 *1st-level conjuration (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
 
 Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.
 
 If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.
 
 #### Vampiric Touch
 
 *3rd-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
 
 #### Wall of Fire

 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.
 
 When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
 
 One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
