 If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.
 
 If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.
 
 #### Death Ward
 
 *4th-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** 8 hours
 
 You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.
 
 The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.
 
 If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.
 
 #### Delayed Blast Fireball
 
 *7th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 150 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
 The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.
 
 If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.
 
 The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
 
 #### Demiplane
 
 *8th-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** S
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.
 
 Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.
 
 #### Detect Evil and Good
 
 *1st-level divination*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.
 
 The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
 
 #### Detect Magic
 
 *1st-level divination (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.
 
 The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
 
 #### Detect Poison and Disease
