 *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:
 - You have resistance to poison damage.
 - You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
 - You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.
 - You can’t be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.
 - You can use an action to cast the *web* spell (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property of the cloak can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 
 #### Cloak of Displacement
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.
 
 #### Cloak of Elvenkind
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, as the cloak’s color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
 
 #### Cloak of Protection
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while you wear this cloak.
 
 #### Cloak of the Bat
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In an area of dim light or darkness, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak’s edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this flying speed.
 
 While wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to cast *polymorph* on yourself, transforming into a bat. While you are in the form of the bat, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
 
 #### Cloak of the Manta Ray
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 While wearing this cloak with its hood up, you can breathe underwater, and you have a swimming speed of 60 feet. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
 
 #### Crystal Ball
 
 *Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement)*
 
 The typical *crystal ball*, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the *scrying* spell (save DC 17) with it.
 
 The following *crystal ball* variants are legendary items and have additional properties.
 
 ***Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.*** You can use an action to cast the *detect thoughts* spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the *crystal ball*, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You don’t need to concentrate on this *detect thoughts* to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends.
 
 ***Crystal Ball of Telepathy.*** While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You can also use an action to cast the *suggestion* spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don’t need to concentrate on this *suggestion* to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends. Once used, the *suggestion* power of the *crystal ball* can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 
 ***Crystal Ball of True Seeing.*** While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell’s sensor.
 
 #### Cube of Force
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.
 
 You can use an action to press one of the cube’s faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube’s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier’s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.
 
 If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can’t pass through the cube, you can’t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.
 
 #### Cube of Force Faces
 
 | Face | Charges | Effect                                                                                                            |
 |------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | 1    | 1       | Gases, wind, and fog can’t pass through the barrier.                                                              |
 | 2    | 2       | Nonliving matter can’t pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion. |
 | 3    | 3       | Living matter can’t pass through the barrier.                                                                     |
 | 4    | 4       | Spell effects can’t pass through the barrier.                                                                     |
 | 5    | 5       | Nothing can pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.            |
 | 6    | 0       | The barrier deactivates.                                                                                          |
 
 The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the table below.
 
 | Spell or Item    | Charges Lost |
 |------------------|--------------|
 | Disintegrate     | 1d12         |
 | Horn of blasting | 1d10         |
 | Passwall         | 1d6          |
 | Prismatic spray  | 1d20         |
 | Wall of fire     | 1d4          |
 
 #### Cubic Gate
 
 *Wondrous item, legendary*
 
 This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.
 
 You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the *gate* spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the *plane shift* spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.
 
 The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
 
 #### Dagger of Venom
 
 *Weapon (dagger), rare*
