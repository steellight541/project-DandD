Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
 
 Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
 
 The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.
 
 The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful *dispel magic* spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.
 
 If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.
 
 #### Augury
 
 *2nd-level divination (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:
 - *Weal*, for good results
 - *Woe*, for bad results
 - *Weal and woe*, for both good and bad results
 - *Nothing*, for results that aren’t especially good or bad
 
 The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
 
 If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.
 
 #### Awaken
 
 *5th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 8 hours
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human’s. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.
 
 The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.
 
 #### Bane
 
 *1st-level enchantment*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.
 
 ***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
 
 #### Banishment
 
 *4th-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.
 
 If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
 
 If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn’t return.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
 
 #### Barkskin
 
 *2nd-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of oak bark)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
 
 You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target’s skin has a rough, bark-like appearance, and the target’s AC can’t be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor it is wearing.
 
 #### Beacon of Hope
 
 *3rd-level abjuration*
