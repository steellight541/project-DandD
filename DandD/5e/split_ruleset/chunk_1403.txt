 #### Flurry of Blows
 
 Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
 
 #### Patient Defense
 
 You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.
 
 #### Step of the Wind
 
 You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.
 
 ### Unarmored Movement
 
 Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.
 
 At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.
 
 ### Monastic Tradition
 
 When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
 
 ### Deflect Missiles
 
 Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.
 
 If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
 
 ### Ability Score Improvement
 
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
 
 ### Slow Fall
 
 Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.
 
 ### Extra Attack
 
 Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
 
 ### Stunning Strike
 
 Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
 
 ### Ki-Empowered Strikes
 
 Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
 
 ### Evasion
 
 At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a *fireball* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
 
 ### Stillness of Mind
 
 Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.
 
 ### Purity of Body
 
 At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.
 
 ### Tongue of the Sun and Moon
 
 Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.
 
 ### Diamond Soul
 
 Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.
 
 Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.
 
 ### Timeless Body
 
 At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.
 
 ### Empty Body
 
 Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.
 
 Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the *astral projection* spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.
 
 ### Perfect Self
 
 At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.
 
 Monastic Traditions
 -------------------
 
 Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.
 
 ### Way of the Open Hand
 
 Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.
 
 #### Open Hand Technique
 
 Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:
 - It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
 - It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
 - It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.
