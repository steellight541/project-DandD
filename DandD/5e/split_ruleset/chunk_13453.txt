 #### Ring of X-ray Vision
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.
 
 Whenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.
 
 #### Robe of Eyes
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:
 - The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
 - You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
 - You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.
 
 The eyes on the robe can’t be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.
 
 A *light* spell cast on the robe or a *daylight* spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for *light* or DC 15 for *daylight*), ending the blindness on a success.
 
 #### Robe of Scintillating Colors
 
 *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe’s power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the effect ends.
 
 #### Robe of Stars
 
 *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.
 
 Six stars, located on the robe’s upper front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of the stars and use it to cast *magic missile* as a 5th-level spell. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.
 
 While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.
 
 #### Robe of the Archmagi
 
 *Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*
 
 This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe’s color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can’t attune to a *robe of the archmagi* that doesn’t correspond to your alignment.
 
 You gain these benefits while wearing the robe:
 - If you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15 + your Dexterity modifier.
 - You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
 - Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2.
 
 #### Robe of Useful Items
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.
 
 The robe has two of each of the following patches:
 - Dagger
 - Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)
 - Steel mirror
 - 10-foot pole
 - Hempen rope (50 feet, coiled)
 - Sack
 
 In addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches. The GM chooses the patches or determines them randomly.

 #### Rod of Absorption
 
 *Rod, very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.
 
 When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.
 
 If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.
 
 A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.
 
 #### Rod of Alertness
 
 *Rod, very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.
 
 ***Alertness.*** While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.
 
 ***Spells.*** While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*, *detect poison and disease*, or *see invisibility.*
