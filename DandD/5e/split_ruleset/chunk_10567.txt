***Sleep.*** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.
 
 ***Stunning.*** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.
 
 #### Telekinesis
 
 *5th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.
 
 ***Creature.*** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.
 
 On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.
 
 ***Object.*** You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.
 
 If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.
 
 You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.
 
 #### Telepathic Bond
 
 *5th-level divination (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren’t affected by this spell.
 
 Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can’t extend to other planes of existence.
 
 #### Teleport
 
 *7th-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 10 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.
 
 The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.
 
 | Familiarity       | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |
 |-------------------|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
 | Permanent circle  | —      | —            | —          | 01–100    |
 | Associated object | —      | —            | —          | 01–100    |
 | Very familiar     | 01–05  | 06–13        | 14–24      | 25–100    |
 | Seen casually     | 01–33  | 34–43        | 44–53      | 54–100    |
 | Viewed once       | 01–43  | 44–53        | 54–73      | 74–100    |
 | Description       | 01–43  | 44–53        | 54–73      | 74–100    |
 | False destination | 01–50  | 51–100       | —          | —         |
 
 ***Familiarity.*** “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. “Associated object” means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb.
 
 “Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.
 
 “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.
 
 ***On Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.
 
 ***Off Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
 
 ***Similar Area.*** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
 
 ***Mishap.*** The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).
 
 #### Teleportation Circle
 
 *5th-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** 10 feet
 
 **Components:** V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** 1 round
 
 As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
 
 Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.
 
 You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.
