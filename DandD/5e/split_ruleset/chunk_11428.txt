 #### Long-Term Madness
 
 | d100   | Effect (lasts 1d10 × 10 hours)                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
 |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | 01–10  | The character feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting coins.                                                                                       |
 | 11–20  | The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks.                                                                                                                                               |
 | 21–30  | The character suffers extreme paranoia. The character has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks.                                                                                                                                |
 | 31–40  | The character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell.                                                                      |
 | 41–45  | The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects.                                                                                                          |
 | 46–55  | The character becomes attached to a “lucky charm,” such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it.                                           |
 | 56–65  | The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%).                                                                                                                                                                                    |
 | 66–75  | The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve Strength or Dexterity.                                                           |
 | 76–85  | The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn’t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect. |
 | 86–90  | Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute.            |
 | 91–95  | The character loses the ability to speak.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
 | 96–100 | The character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or damage can wake the character.                                                                                                                                             |
 
 #### Indefinite Madness
 
 | d100   | Flaw (lasts until cured)                                                                                                                 |
 |--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | 01–15  | “Being drunk keeps me sane.”                                                                                                             |
 | 16–25  | “I keep whatever I find.”                                                                                                                |
 | 26–30  | “I try to become more like someone else I know—adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name.”                                |
 | 31–35  | “I must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people.”                                                  |
 | 36–45  | “Achieving my goal is the only thing of interest to me, and I’ll ignore everything else to pursue it.”                                   |
 | 46–50  | “I find it hard to care about anything that goes on around me.”                                                                          |
 | 51–55  | “I don’t like the way people judge me all the time.”                                                                                     |
 | 56–70  | “I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person I know.”                                                       |
 | 71–80  | “I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they’re watching me all the time.” |
 | 81–85  | “There’s only one person I can trust. And only I can see this special friend.”                                                           |
 | 86–95  | “I can’t take anything seriously. The more serious the situation, the funnier I find it.”                                                |
 | 96–100 | “I’ve discovered that I really like killing people.”                                                                                     |
 
 ### Curing Madness
 
 A *calm emotions* spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a *lesser restoration* spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, *remove curse* or *dispel evil* might also prove effective. A *greater restoration* spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.
 
 Objects
 =======
 
 When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire’s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character’s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.
 
 For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.
 
 #### Statistics for Objects
 
 When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.
 
 ***Armor Class.*** An object’s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.
 
 ##### Object Armor Class
 
 | Substance           | AC |
 |---------------------|----|
 | Cloth, paper, rope  | 11 |
 | Crystal, glass, ice | 13 |
 | Wood, bone          | 15 |
 | Stone               | 17 |
 | Iron, steel         | 19 |
 | Mithral             | 21 |
 | Adamantine          | 23 |
 
 ***Hit Points.*** An object’s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.
 
 ##### Object Hit Points
 
 ***Huge and Gargantuan Objects.*** Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an *earthquake* spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object’s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.
 
 ***Objects and Damage Types.*** Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can’t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.
 
 ***Damage Threshold.*** Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hit points.
 
 | Size                                  | Fragile  | Resilient |
 |---------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
 | Tiny (bottle, lock)                   | 2 (1d4)  | 5 (2d4)   |
 | Small (chest, lute)                   | 3 (1d6)  | 10 (3d6)  |
 | Medium (barrel, chandelier)           | 4 (1d8)  | 18 (4d8)  |
 | Large (cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window) | 5 (1d10) | 27 (5d10) |
 
 Poisons
 =======
 
 Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.
 
 Poisons come in the following four types.
 
 ***Contact.*** Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.
 
 ***Ingested.*** A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.
 
 ***Inhaled.*** These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
 
 ***Injury.*** Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.
 
 ##### Poisons
 
 | Item               | Type     | Price per Dose |
 |--------------------|----------|----------------|
 | Assassin’s blood   | Ingested | 150 gp         |
