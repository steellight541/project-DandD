 You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

 #### Prestidigitation
 
 *Transmutation cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 10 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Up to 1 hour
 
 This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
 - You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
 - You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
 - You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
 - You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
 - You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
 - You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.
 
 If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
 
 #### Prismatic Spray
 
 *7th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.
 
 1.  ***Red.*** The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 2.  ***Orange.*** The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 3.  ***Yellow.*** The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 4.  ***Green.*** The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 5.  ***Blue.*** The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 6.  ***Indigo.*** On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
 7.  ***Violet.*** On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
 8.  ***Special.*** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.
