 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Special
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)
 
 **Duration:** 8 hours
 
 This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.
 
 If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.
 
 You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.
 
 If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.
 
 #### Earthquake
 
 *8th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 500 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.
 
 The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.
 
 Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken.
 
 When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
 
 This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM. ***Fissures.*** Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.
 
 A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).
 
 ***Structures.*** The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.
 
 #### Enhance Ability
 
 *2nd-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (fur or a feather from a beast)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour.
 
 You touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.
 
 ***Bear’s Endurance***. The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the spell ends.
 
 ***Bull’s Strength***. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.
 
 ***Cat’s Grace***. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t incapacitated.
 
 ***Eagle’s Splendor***. The target has advantage on Charisma checks.
 
 ***Fox’s Cunning***. The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.
 
 ***Owl’s Wisdom***. The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.
 
 ***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
 
 #### Enlarge/Reduce
 
 *2nd-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.
 
 If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.
 
 ***Enlarge.*** The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category— from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.
 
 ***Reduce.*** The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).
 
 #### Entangle
 
 *1st-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 90 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
