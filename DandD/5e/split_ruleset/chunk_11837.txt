 #### Berserker Axe
 
 *Weapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement)*
 
 You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
 
 ***Curse.*** This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.
 
 Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.
 
 #### Boots of Elvenkind
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.
 
 #### Boots of Levitation
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While you wear these boots, you can use an action to cast the *levitate* spell on yourself at will.
 
 #### Boots of Speed
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots’ heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.
 
 When the boots’ property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.
 
 #### Boots of Striding and Springing
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn’t reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three times the normal distance, though you can’t jump farther than your remaining movement would allow.
 
 #### Boots of the Winterlands
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 These furred boots are snug and feel quite warm. While you wear them, you gain the following benefits:
 - You have resistance to cold damage.
 - You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.
 - You can tolerate temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as −100 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
 #### Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals
 
 *Wondrous item, rare*
 
 While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl’s command word and summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the *conjure elemental* spell. The bowl can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
 
 The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
 
 #### Bracers of Archery

 While wearing these bracers, you have proficiency with the longbow and shortbow, and you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls on ranged attacks made with such weapons.
 
 #### Bracers of Defense

 While wearing these bracers, you gain a +2 bonus to AC if you are wearing no armor and using no shield.
 
 #### Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals
 
 *Wondrous item, rare*
 
 While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak the brazier’s command word and summon a fire elemental, as if you had cast the *conjure elemental* spell. The brazier can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
 
 The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
 
 #### Brooch of Shielding
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this brooch, you have resistance to force damage, and you have immunity to damage from the *magic missile* spell.
 
 #### Broom of Flying
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.
 
 You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.
 
 #### Candle of Invocation
 
 *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity’s alignment. The candle’s alignment can be detected with the *detect evil and good* spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.
