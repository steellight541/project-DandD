You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target’s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected.
 
 A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
 
 If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.
 
 If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.
 
 #### Floating Disk
 
 *1st-level conjuration (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.
 
 The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.
 
 If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.
 
 #### Fly
 
 *3rd-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
 
 #### Fog Cloud
 
 *1st-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
 
 You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.
 
 #### Forbiddance
 
 *6th-level abjuration (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)
 
 **Duration:** 1 day
 
 You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the *gate* spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the *plane shift* spell.
 
 In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).
 
 When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.
 
 The spell’s area can’t overlap with the area of another *forbiddance* spell. If you cast *forbiddance* every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.
 
 #### Forcecage
 
 *7th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 100 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.
 
 A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.
 
 A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.
 
 When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.
 
 A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
 
 This spell can’t be dispelled by *dispel magic*.
