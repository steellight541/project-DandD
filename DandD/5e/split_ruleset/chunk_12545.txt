 When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.
 
 The third command word causes the *folding boat* to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can’t fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.
 
 #### Frost Brand
 
 *Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. In addition, while you hold the sword, you have resistance to fire damage.
 
 In freezing temperatures, the blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
 
 When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you. This property can be used no more than once per hour.
 
 #### Gauntlets of Ogre Power
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 Your Strength score is 19 while you wear these gauntlets. They have no effect on you if your Strength is already 19 or higher.
 
 #### Gem of Brightness
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:
 - The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn’t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.
 - The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
 - The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30- foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.
 
 When all of the gem’s charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.
 
 #### Gem of Seeing
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This gem has 3 charges. As an action, you can speak the gem’s command word and expend 1 charge. For the next 10 minutes, you have truesight out to 120 feet when you peer through the gem.
 
 The gem regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
 
 #### Giant Slayer
 
 *Weapon (any axe or sword), rare*
 
 You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
 
 When you hit a giant with it, the giant takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon’s type and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. For the purpose of this weapon, “giant” refers to any creature with the giant type, including ettins and trolls.
 
 #### Glamoured Studded Leather
 
 *Armor (studded leather), rare*
 
 While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also use a bonus action to speak the armor’s command word and cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessories, but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armor.
 
 #### Gloves of Missile Snaring
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you’re wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.
 
 #### Gloves of Swimming and Climbing
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don’t cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.
 
 #### Goggles of Night
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.
 
 #### Hammer of Thunderbolts
 
 *Weapon (maul), legendary*
 
 You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
 
 ***Giant’s Bane (Requires Attunement).*** You must be wearing a *belt of giant strength* (any variety) and *gauntlets of ogre power* to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.
 
 The hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. The hammer regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.
 
 #### Handy Haversack
 
 *Wondrous item, rare*
 
 This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.
 
 Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.
 
 The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.
 
 Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a *bag of holding*, *portable hole*, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.
 
 #### Hat of Disguise
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the *disguise self* spell from it at will. The spell ends if the hat is removed.
 
 #### Headband of Intellect
