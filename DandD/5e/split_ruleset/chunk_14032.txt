 #### Wand of Magic Missiles
 
 *Wand, uncommon*
 
 This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the *magic missile* spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.
 
 The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
 
 #### Wand of Paralysis
 
 *Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*
 
 This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
 
 The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

 #### Wand of Secrets

 #### Wand of the War Mage, +1, +2, or +3

 #### Wand of Web

 #### Wand of Wonder
 
 *Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*
 
 This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 120 feet of you. The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll d100 and consult the following table to discover what happens.
 
 If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell’s save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it isn’t already.
 
 If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the GM randomly determines which ones are affected.
 
 The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.

 | 66–69  | You shrink yourself as if you had cast enlarge/reduce on yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
 | 70–79  | You cast fireball.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
 | 80–84  | You cast invisibility on yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
 | 85–87  | Leaves grow from the target. If you chose a point in space as the target, leaves sprout from the creature nearest to that point. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
 | 88–90  | A stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 gp, shoots from the wand’s tip in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
 | 91–95  | A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
 | 96–97  | The target’s skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days. If you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to that point is affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
 | 98–100 | If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If you didn’t target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly petrified. On any other failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic. |
 
 #### Weapon, +1, +2, or +3
 
 *Weapon (any), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)*
 
 You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus is determined by the weapon’s rarity.
 
 #### Well of Many Worlds
 
 *Wondrous item, legendary*
 
 This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.
 
 You can use an action to unfold and place the *well of many worlds* on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once *well of many worlds* has opened a portal, it can’t do so again for 1d8 hours.
 
 #### Wind Fan
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the *gust of wind* spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn’t be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.
 
 #### Winged Boots
