***Similar Area.*** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
 
 ***Mishap.*** The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).
 
 #### Teleportation Circle
 
 *5th-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** 10 feet
 
 **Components:** V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** 1 round
 
 As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
 
 Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.
 
 You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.
 
 #### Thaumaturgy
 
 *Transmutation cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Up to 1 minute
 
 You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
 - Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.
 - You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
 - You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
 - You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
 - You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
 - You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
 
 #### Thunderwave
 
 *1st-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self (15-foot cube)
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.
 
 In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
 
 #### Time Stop
 
 *9th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.
 
 This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.
 
 #### Tiny Hut
 
 *3rd-level evocation (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Self (10-foot-radius hemisphere)
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal bead)
 
 **Duration:** 8 hours
 
 A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.
 
 Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.
 
 Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.
 
 #### Tongues
 
 *3rd-level divination*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
