 This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving throw instead.
 
 #### Ring of Feather Falling
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 When you fall while wearing this ring, you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling.
 
 #### Ring of Free Action
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While you wear this ring, difficult terrain doesn’t cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be paralyzed or restrained.
 
 #### Ring of Invisibility
 
 *Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you can turn invisible as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you. You remain invisible until the ring is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again.
 
 #### Ring of Jumping
 
 *Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you can cast the *jump* spell from it as a bonus action at will, but can target only yourself when you do so.
 
 #### Ring of Mind Shielding
 
 *Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.
 
 You can use an action to cause the ring to become invisible until you use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.
 
 If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can’t prevent this telepathic communication.
 
 #### Ring of Protection
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while wearing this ring.
 
 #### Ring of Regeneration
 
 *Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this ring, you regain 1d6 hit points every 10 minutes, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after 1d6 + 1 days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
 
 #### Ring of Resistance
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 You have resistance to one damage type while wearing this ring. The gem in the ring indicates the type, which the GM chooses or determines randomly.

 | 2   | Cold        | Tourmaline |

 | 4   | Force       | Sapphire   |
 | 5   | Lightning   | Citrine    |
 | 6   | Necrotic    | Jet        |
 | 7   | Poison      | Amethyst   |

 #### Ring of Shooting Stars
 
 *Ring, very rare (requires attunement outdoors at night)*
 
 While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast *dancing lights* and *light* from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.
 
 The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.
 
 ***Faerie Fire.*** You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast *faerie fire* from the ring.
 
 ***Ball Lightning.*** You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.
 
 Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.
 
 As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.
 
 | Spheres | Lightning Damage |
 |---------|------------------|
 | 4       | 2d4              |
 | 3       | 2d6              |
 | 2       | 5d4              |
 | 1       | 4d12             |
 
 ***Shooting Stars.*** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
 #### Ring of Spell Storing
 
 *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.
 
 Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
