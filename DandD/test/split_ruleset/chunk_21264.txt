 ***Corrode Metal.*** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.
 
 The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.
 
 ***False Appearance.*** While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an oily pool or wet rock.
