 **Components:** V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Until dispelled
 
 By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.
 
 If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.
 
 You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.
 
 #### Shapechange
 
 *9th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
 
 You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.
 
 Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.
 
 You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
 
 You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.
 
 When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.
 
 During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.
 
 #### Shatter
 
 *2nd-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.
 
 A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
 
 #### Shield
 
 *1st-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the *magic missile* spell
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** 1 round
 
 An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from *magic missile.*
 
 #### Shield of Faith
 
 *1st-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a small parchment with a bit of holy text written on it)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.
 
 #### Shillelagh
 
 *Transmutation cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)
 
 **Duration:** 1 minute
 
 The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature’s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn’t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.
 
 #### Shocking Grasp
 
 *Evocation cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
