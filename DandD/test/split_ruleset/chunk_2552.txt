 *Prerequisite: 9th level*
 
 You can cast *levitate* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.
 
 #### Beast Speech
 
 You can cast *speak with animals* at will, without expending a spell slot.
 
 #### Beguiling Influence
 
 You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.
 
 #### Bewitching Whispers
 
 *Prerequisite: 7th level*
 
 You can cast *compulsion* once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
 
 #### Book of Ancient Secrets
 
 *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*
 
 You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.
 
 On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

 #### Gaze of Two Minds
 
 You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.
