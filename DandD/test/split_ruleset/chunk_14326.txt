### Alignment
 
 A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the *Player’s Handbook* for descriptions of the different alignments.
 
 The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.
 
 Some creatures can have **any alignment**. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.
 
 Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means they don’t have an alignment.
 
 ### Armor Class
 
 A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.
 
 ### Hit Points
 
 A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the *Player’s Handbook.*
 
 A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).
 
 A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.
 
 #### Hit Dice by Size
 
 | Monster Size | Hit Die | Average HP per Die |
 |--------------|---------|--------------------|
 | Tiny         | d4      | 2½                 |
 | Small        | d6      | 3½                 |
 | Medium       | d8      | 4½                 |
 | Large        | d10     | 5½                 |
 | Huge         | d12     | 6½                 |
 | Gargantuan   | d20     | 10½                |
 
 
 A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).
 
 ### Speed
 
 A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the *Player’s Handbook.*
 
 All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.
 
 Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.
 
 #### Burrow
 
 A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.
 
 #### Climb
 
 A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.
 
 #### Fly
 
 A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to **hover**, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the *Player’s Handbook*). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.
 
 #### Swim
 
 A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.
 
 ### Ability Scores
 
 Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used in play, see the *Player’s Handbook.*
 
 ### Saving Throws
 
 The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.
 
 A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).
 
 #### Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating
 
 
 | Challenge | Proficiency Bonus |
 |-----------|-------------------|
 | 0         | +2                |
 | 1/8       | +2                |
 | 1/4       | +2                |
 | 1/2       | +2                |

 | 21        | +7                |
 | 22        | +7                |
