The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.
 
 Cover
 -----
 
 Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.
 
 There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.
 
 A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.
 
 A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.
 
 A target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
 
 Damage and Healing
 ------------------
 
 Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a *fireball* spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.
 
 ### Hit Points
 
 Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.
 
 A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.
 
 Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.
 
 ### Damage Rolls
 
 Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.
 
 When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage. A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.
 
 If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more** **than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts *fireball* or a cleric casts *flame strike*, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.
 
 #### Critical Hits
 
 When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.
 
 For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.
 
 #### Damage Types
 
 Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.
 
 The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.
 
 ***Acid.*** The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.
 
 ***Bludgeoning.*** Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.
 
 ***Cold.*** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.
 
 ***Fire.*** Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.
 
 ***Force.*** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including *magic missile* and *spiritual weapon*.
 
 ***Lightning.*** A *lightning bolt* spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.
 
 ***Necrotic.*** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as *chill touch*, withers matter and even the soul.
 
 ***Piercing.*** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.
 
 ***Poison.*** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.
 
 ***Psychic.*** Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.
 
 ***Radiant.*** Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s *flame strike* spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.
 
 ***Slashing.*** Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.
 
 ***Thunder.*** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the *thunderwave* spell, deals thunder damage.
 
 ### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability
 
 Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.
 
 If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.
 
 Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.
 
 Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three- quarters.
 
 ### Healing
 
 Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a *cure wounds* spell or a *potion of healing* can remove damage in an instant.
 
 When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.
 
 A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the *revivify* spell has restored it to life.
 
 ### Dropping to 0 Hit Points
 
 When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.
 
 #### Instant Death
 
 Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.
 
 For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.
