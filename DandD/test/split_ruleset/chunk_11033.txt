**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cork)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.
 
 If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.
 
 #### Web
 
 *2nd-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
 
 You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20- foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.
 
 If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
 
 Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a
 
 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
 
 A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
 
 The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
 
 #### Weird
 
 *9th-level illusion*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute
 
 Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
 
 #### Wind Walk
 
 *6th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (fire and holy water)
 
 **Duration:** 8 hours
 
 You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.
 
 If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.
 
 #### Wind Wall
 
 *3rd-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.
 
 When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
 The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.
 
 #### Wish
 
 *9th-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 *Wish* is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.
 
 The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.
 
 Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:
 - You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
 - You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the *greater restoration* spell.
 - You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
 - You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.
