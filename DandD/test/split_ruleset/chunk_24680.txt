 ***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.
 
 ***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.
 
 **Actions**
 
 ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
