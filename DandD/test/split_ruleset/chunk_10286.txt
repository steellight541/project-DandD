 #### Speak with Animals
 
 *1st-level divination (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** 10 minutes
 
 You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM’s discretion.
 
 #### Speak with Dead
 
 *3rd-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 10 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense)
 
 **Duration:** 10 minutes
 
 You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
 
 Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.
 
 #### Speak with Plants
 
 *3rd-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** 10 minutes
 
 You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.
 
 You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.
 
 Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.
 
 If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.
 
 This spell can cause the plants created by the *entangle* spell to release a restrained creature.
 
 #### Spider Climb
 
 *2nd-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
 
 Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.
 
 #### Spike Growth
 
 *2nd-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 150 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
 
 The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
 
 #### Spirit Guardians
 
 *3rd-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self (15-foot radius)
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a holy symbol)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.
 
 When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
