 *1st-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, M (a small feather or piece of down)
 
 **Duration:** 1 minute
 
 Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature’s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.
 
 #### Feeblemind
 
 *8th-level enchantment*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 150 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.
 
 On a failed save, the creature’s Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can’t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.
 
 At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends.
 
 The spell can also be ended by *greater restoration*, *heal*, or *wish.*
 
 #### Find Steed
 
 *2nd-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
 
 Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.
 
 When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.
 
 While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.
 
 You can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.
 
 #### Find the Path
 
 *6th-level divination*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools— such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes—worth 100 gp and an object from the location you wish to find)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day
 
 This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn’t specific (such as “a green dragon’s lair”), the spell fails.
 
 For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.
 
 #### Find Traps
 
 *2nd-level divination*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the *alarm* spell, a *glyph of warding*, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
 
 This spell merely reveals that a trap is present.
 
 You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
 
 #### Finger of Death
 
 *7th-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
