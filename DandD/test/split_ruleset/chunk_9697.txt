 This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
 
 Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
 
 #### Ray of Enfeeblement
 
 *2nd-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the spell ends.
 
 At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.
 
 #### Ray of Frost
 
 *Evocation cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
 
 The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
 
 #### Regenerate
 
 *7th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).
 
 The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.
 
 #### Reincarnate
 
 *5th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 hour
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.
 
 If the target’s soul isn’t free or willing to do so, the spell fails.
 
 The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature’s race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.
 
 | d100  | Race                |
 |-------|---------------------|
 | 01–04 | Dragonborn          |
 | 05–13 | Dwarf, hill         |
 | 14–21 | Dwarf, mountain     |
 | 22–25 | Elf, dark           |
 | 26–34 | Elf, high           |
 | 35–42 | Elf, wood           |
 | 43–46 | Gnome, forest       |
 | 47–52 | Gnome, rock         |
 | 53–56 | Half-elf            |
 | 57–60 | Half-orc            |
 | 61–68 | Halfling, lightfoot |
 | 69–76 | Halfling, stout     |
 | 77–96 | Human               |
 | 97–00 | Tiefling            |
 
 The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.
 
 #### Remove Curse
 
 *3rd-level abjuration*
