If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell’s save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it isn’t already.
 
 If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the GM randomly determines which ones are affected.
 
 The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.

 | 80–84  | You cast invisibility on yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
 | 85–87  | Leaves grow from the target. If you chose a point in space as the target, leaves sprout from the creature nearest to that point. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
 | 88–90  | A stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 gp, shoots from the wand’s tip in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
 | 91–95  | A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
 | 96–97  | The target’s skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days. If you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to that point is affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
 | 98–100 | If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If you didn’t target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly petrified. On any other failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic. |
 
 #### Weapon, +1, +2, or +3
 
 *Weapon (any), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)*
 
 You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus is determined by the weapon’s rarity.
 
 #### Well of Many Worlds
 
 *Wondrous item, legendary*
 
 This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.
 
 You can use an action to unfold and place the *well of many worlds* on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once *well of many worlds* has opened a portal, it can’t do so again for 1d8 hours.
 
 #### Wind Fan
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the *gust of wind* spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn’t be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.
 
 #### Winged Boots
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
 
 While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.
 
 The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren’t in use.
 
 #### Wings of Flying
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can’t use them again for 1d12 hours.
 
 Sentient Magic Items
 --------------------
 
 Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.
 
 Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.
 
 Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.
 
 ### Creating Sentient Magic Items
 
 When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.
 
 #### Abilities
 
 A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.
 
 #### Communication
 
 A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.
 
 | d100   | Communication                                                                                                                                                      |
 |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | 01–60  | The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.                                                                             |
 | 61–90  | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages.                                                                                                    |
 | 91–100 | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it. |
 
 #### Senses
 
 With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table.
 
 | d4 | Senses                                     |
 |----|--------------------------------------------|
 | 1  | Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.  |
 | 2  | Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet   |
 | 3  | Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet. |
 | 4  | Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.    |
