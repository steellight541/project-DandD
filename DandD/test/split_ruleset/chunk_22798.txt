 Appendix PH-A: Conditions
 ======================
 
 Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.
 
 A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.
 
 If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.
 
 The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.
 
 #### Blinded
 - A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
 - Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
 
 #### Charmed
 - A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
 - The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.
 
 #### Deafened
 - A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.
 
 #### Exhaustion
 
 Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.
 
 | Level | Effect                                         |
 |-------|------------------------------------------------|
 | 1     | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
 | 2     | Speed halved                                   |
 | 3     | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
 | 4     | Hit point maximum halved                       |
 | 5     | Speed reduced to 0                             |
 | 6     | Death                                          |
