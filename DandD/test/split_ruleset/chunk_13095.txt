While you’re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the *etherealness* spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 
 #### Portable Hole
 
 *Wondrous item, rare*
 
 This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.
 
 You can use an action to unfold a *portable hole* and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the *portable hole* creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open *portable hole* can exit the hole by climbing out of it.
 
 You can use an action to close a *portable hole* by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.
 
 If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the *portable hole* or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed *portable hole* can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.
 
 Placing a *portable hole* inside an extradimensional space created by a *bag of holding*, *handy haversack*, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.
 
 #### Potion of Animal Friendship
 
 *Potion, uncommon*
 
 When you drink this potion, you can cast the *animal friendship* spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.
 
 #### Potion of Clairvoyance
 
 *Potion, rare*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *clairvoyance* spell. An eyeball bobs in this yellowish liquid but vanishes when the potion is opened.
 
 #### Potion of Climbing
 
 *Potion, common*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.
 
 #### Potion of Diminution
 
 *Potion, rare*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
 
 #### Potion of Flying
 
 *Potion, very rare*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you’re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potion’s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.
 
 #### Potion of Gaseous Form
 
 *Potion, rare*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *gaseous form* spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion’s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
 
 #### Potion of Giant Strength
 
 *Potion, rarity varies*
 
 When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.
 
 This potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The *potion of frost giant strength* and the *potion of stone giant strength* have the same effect.
 
 | Type of Giant     | Strength | Rarity    |
 |-------------------|----------|-----------|
 | Hill giant        | 21       | Uncommon  |
 | Frost/stone giant | 23       | Rare      |
 | Fire giant        | 25       | Rare      |
 | Cloud giant       | 27       | Very rare |
 | Storm giant       | 29       | Legendary |
 
 #### Potion of Growth
 
 *Potion, uncommon*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
 
 #### Potion of Healing
 
 *Potion, rarity varies*
 
 You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion’s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion’s red liquid glimmers when agitated.
 
 ##### Potions of Healing
 
 | Potion of ...    | Rarity    | HP Regained |
 |------------------|-----------|-------------|
 | Healing          | Common    | 2d4 + 2     |
 | Greater healing  | Uncommon  | 4d4 + 4     |
 | Superior healing | Rare      | 8d4 + 8     |
 | Supreme healing  | Very rare | 10d4 + 20   |
 
 #### Potion of Heroism
 
 *Potion, rare*
 
 For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the *bless* spell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.
 
 #### Potion of Invisibility
 
 *Potion, very rare*
 
 This potion’s container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
