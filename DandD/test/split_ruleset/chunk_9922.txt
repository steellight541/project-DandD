 #### Sanctuary
 
 *1st-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a small silver mirror)
 
 **Duration:** 1 minute
 
 You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.
 
 If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.
 
 #### Scorching Ray
 
 *2nd-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.
 
 Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.
 
 #### Scrying
 
 *5th-level divination*
 
 **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.
 
 | Knowledge                                 | Save Modifier |
 |-------------------------------------------|---------------|
 | Secondhand (you have heard of the target) | +5            |
 | Firsthand (you have met the target)       | +0            |
 | Familiar (you know the target well)       | −5            |
 
 | Connection                                        | Save Modifier |
 |---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
 | Likeness or picture                               | −2            |
 | Possession or garment                             | −4            |
 | Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like | −10           |
 
 On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.
 
 On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.
 
 Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t move.
 
 #### Secret Chest
 
 *4th-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).
 
 While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.
 
 After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell’s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.
 
 #### See Invisibility
 
 *2nd-level divination*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.
