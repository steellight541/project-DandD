 ### Conflict
 
 A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:
 - The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.
 - The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.
 - The item demands that its wielder pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.
 - The item demands to be given to someone else. If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’s wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:
 - Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.
 - Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
 - Attempt to take control of its wielder.
 
 If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn.
 
 Artifacts
 ---------
 
 #### Orb of Dragonkind
 
 *Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*
 
 Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five *Orbs of Dragonkind* (or *Dragon Orbs*) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.
 
 As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.
 
 Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.
 
 An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.
 
 While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.
 
 While you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts *suggestion* on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.
 
 ***Random Properties.*** An *Orb of Dragonkind* has the following random properties:
 - 2 minor beneficial properties
 - 1 minor detrimental property
 - 1 major detrimental property
 
 ***Spells.*** The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: *cure wounds* (5th-level version, 3 charges), *daylight* (1 charge), *death ward* (2 charges), or *scrying* (3 charges).
 
 You can also use an action to cast the *detect magic* spell from the orb without using any charges.
 
 ***Call Dragons.*** While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.
 
 ***Destroying an Orb.*** An *Orb of Dragonkind* appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A *disintegrate* spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.
 
 Monsters
 ========
 
 A monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its **stat block**, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.
 
 ##### Modifying Creatures
 
 Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a **variant** or **template**, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.
 
 ### Size
 
 A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the *Player’s Handbook* for more information on creature size and space.
 
 #### Size Categories
 
 | Size       | Space                  | Examples            |
 |------------|------------------------|---------------------|
 | Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ ft.           | Imp, sprite         |
 | Small      | 5 by 5 ft.             | Giant rat, goblin   |
 | Medium     | 5 by 5 ft.             | Orc, werewolf       |
 | Large      | 10 by 10 ft.           | Hippogriff, ogre    |
 | Huge       | 15 by 15 ft.           | Fire giant, treant  |
 | Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger | Kraken, purple worm |
 
 ### Type
 
 A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an *arrow of dragon slaying* deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.
 
 The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.
 
 **Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.
 
 **Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.
 
 **Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper
 
 Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.
 
 **Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.
 
 **Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.
 
 **Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.
