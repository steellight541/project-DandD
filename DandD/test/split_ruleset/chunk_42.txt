 ### Racial Traits
 
 The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.
 
 #### Ability Score Increase
 
 Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.
 
 #### Age
 
 The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.
 
 #### Alignment
 
 Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.
 
 #### Size
 
 Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”
 
 #### Speed
 
 Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).
 
 #### Languages
 
 By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.
 
 #### Subraces
 
 Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world.

 ### Dwarf Traits
 
 Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.
 
 ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2.
 
 ***Age.*** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.
 
 ***Alignment.*** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.
 
 ***Size.*** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.
 
 ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.
 
 ***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
 
 ***Dwarven Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
 
 ***Dwarven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.
 
 ***Tool Proficiency.*** You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.
 
 ***Stonecunning.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.
 
 ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.
 
 #### Hill Dwarf
 
 As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience.
 
 ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
 
 ***Dwarven Toughness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.
 
 Elf

 ### Elf Traits
 
 Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.
 
 ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
 
 ***Age.*** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.
 
 ***Alignment.*** Elves love freedom, variety, and self- expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.
 
 ***Size.*** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
 
 ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
 
 ***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
 
 ***Keen Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
 
 ***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
 
 ***Trance.*** Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.
 
 After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
 
 ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
