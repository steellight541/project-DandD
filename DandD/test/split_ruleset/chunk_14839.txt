 **Legendary Actions**
 
 The solar can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The solar regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
 
 **Teleport.** The solar magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
 
 **Searing Burst (Costs 2 Actions).** The solar emits magical, divine energy. Each creature of its choice in a 10-foot radius must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
 **Blinding Gaze (Costs 3 Actions).** The solar targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see it, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until magic such as the *lesser restoration* spell removes the blindness.
