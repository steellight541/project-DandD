*5th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.
 
 The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space.
 
 When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.
 
 ***Clenched Fist.*** The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
 
 ***Forceful Hand.*** The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.
 
 Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.
 
 ***Grasping Hand.*** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
 
 ***Interposing Hand.*** The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.
 
 #### Arcane Lock
 
 *2nd-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Until dispelled
 
 You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting *knock* on the object suppresses *arcane lock* for 10 minutes.
 
 While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.
 
 #### Arcane Sword
 
 *7th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.
 
 When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.
 
 #### Arcanist’s Magic Aura
 
 *2nd-level illusion*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)
 
 **Duration:** 24 hours
 
 You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature.
 
 When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.
 
 ***False Aura.*** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as *detect magic*, that detect magical auras*.* You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.
 
 ***Mask.*** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a *symbol* spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.
 
 #### Astral Projection
 
 *9th-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 hour
 
 **Range:** 10 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Special
 
 You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.
 
 Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
 
 Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
 
 The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.
 
 The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful *dispel magic* spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.
