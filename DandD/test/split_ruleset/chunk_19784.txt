 #### Harpy
 
 *Medium monstrosity, chaotic evil*

 **Senses** passive Perception 10
 
 **Languages** Common
 
 **Challenge** 1 (200 XP)
 
 **Actions**
 
 ***Multiattack.*** The harpy makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its club.
 
 ***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage.
 
 ***Club.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.
 
 ***Luring Song.*** The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.
 
 While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.
 
 A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy’s song for the next 24 hours.
