 ### Tiefling Traits
 
 Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal descent.
 
 ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.
 
 ***Age.*** Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.
 
 ***Alignment.*** Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.
 
 ***Size.*** Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.
 
 ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
 
 ***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
 
 ***Hellish Resistance.*** You have resistance to fire damage.
 
 ***Infernal Legacy.*** You know the *thaumaturgy* cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *hellish rebuke* spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the *darkness* spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
 
 ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.

 ### Rage
 
 In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
 
 While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:
 
 - You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
 - When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
 - You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
 
 If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
 
 Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
 
 Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.
