You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn’t possible.
 
 #### Stoneskin
 
 *4th-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
 
 This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
 
 #### Storm of Vengeance
 
 *9th-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Sight
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.
 
 Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces additional effects on your turn.
 
 ***Round 2.*** Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.
 
 ***Round 3.*** You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can’t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
 ***Round 4.*** Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
 
 ***Round 5–10.*** Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.
 
 #### Suggestion
 
 *2nd-level enchantment*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours
 
 You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
 
 The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
 
 You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed.
 
 If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.
 
 #### Sunbeam
 
 *6th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self (60-foot line)
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.
 
 You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.
 
 For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
 
 #### Sunburst
 
 *8th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 150 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.
 
 A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.
 
 This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
 
 #### Symbol
 
 *7th-level abjuration*
