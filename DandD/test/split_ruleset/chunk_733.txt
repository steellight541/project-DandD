 ### Spellcasting
 
 As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.
 
 #### Cantrips
 
 At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.
 
 #### Preparing and Casting Spells
 
 The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
 
 You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 
 For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
 
 You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
 
 #### Spellcasting Ability
 
 Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
 
 **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
 
 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
 
 #### Ritual Casting
 
 You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
 
 #### Spellcasting Focus
 
 You can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.
 
 ### Divine Domain
 
 Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.
 
 #### Domain Spells
 
 Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells— that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
 
 If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
 
 ### Channel Divinity
 
 At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.
 
 When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
 
 Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.
 
 Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel
 
 Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
 
 #### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
