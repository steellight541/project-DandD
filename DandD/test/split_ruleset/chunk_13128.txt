 #### Potion of Diminution
 
 *Potion, rare*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
 
 #### Potion of Flying
 
 *Potion, very rare*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you’re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potion’s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.
 
 #### Potion of Gaseous Form
 
 *Potion, rare*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *gaseous form* spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion’s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
 
 #### Potion of Giant Strength
 
 *Potion, rarity varies*
 
 When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.
 
 This potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The *potion of frost giant strength* and the *potion of stone giant strength* have the same effect.
 
 | Type of Giant     | Strength | Rarity    |
 |-------------------|----------|-----------|
 | Hill giant        | 21       | Uncommon  |
 | Frost/stone giant | 23       | Rare      |
 | Fire giant        | 25       | Rare      |
 | Cloud giant       | 27       | Very rare |
 | Storm giant       | 29       | Legendary |
 
 #### Potion of Growth
 
 *Potion, uncommon*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
 
 #### Potion of Healing
 
 *Potion, rarity varies*
 
 You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion’s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion’s red liquid glimmers when agitated.
 
 ##### Potions of Healing
 
 | Potion of ...    | Rarity    | HP Regained |
 |------------------|-----------|-------------|
 | Healing          | Common    | 2d4 + 2     |
 | Greater healing  | Uncommon  | 4d4 + 4     |
 | Superior healing | Rare      | 8d4 + 8     |
 | Supreme healing  | Very rare | 10d4 + 20   |
 
 #### Potion of Heroism
 
 *Potion, rare*
 
 For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the *bless* spell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.
 
 #### Potion of Invisibility
 
 *Potion, very rare*
 
 This potion’s container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
 
 #### Potion of Mind Reading
 
 *Potion, rare*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *detect thoughts* spell (save DC 13). The potion’s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.
 
 #### Potion of Poison
 
 *Potion, uncommon*
 
 This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a *potion of healing* or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An *identify* spell reveals its true nature.
 
 If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.
 
 #### Potion of Resistance
 
 *Potion, uncommon*
 
 When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage for 1 hour. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.
 
 | d10 | Damage Type |
 |-----|-------------|
 | 1   | Acid        |
 | 2   | Cold        |
 | 3   | Fire        |
 | 4   | Force       |
 | 5   | Lightning   |
 | 6   | Necrotic    |
 | 7   | Poison      |
 | 8   | Psychic     |
 | 9   | Radiant     |
 | 10  | Thunder     |
