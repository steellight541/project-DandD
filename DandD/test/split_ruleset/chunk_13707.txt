If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature’s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.
 
 If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the *gate* spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a *portable hole*, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.
 
 | d100   | Result                                                                                                                             |
 |--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | 01–50  | The sphere is destroyed.                                                                                                           |
 | 51–85  | The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.                                                            |
 | 86–00  | A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence. |
 
 #### Staff of Charming
 
 *Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*
 
 While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast *charm person*, *command*, *or comprehend languages* from it using your spell save DC. The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.
 
 If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can’t use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff’s intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

 ***Retributive Strike.*** You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.
 
 You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.

On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell’s level. However, if doing so brings the staff’s total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).
