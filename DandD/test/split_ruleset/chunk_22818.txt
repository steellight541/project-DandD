 Appendix PH-A: Conditions
 ======================
 
 Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.
 
 A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.
 
 If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.
 
 The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.
 
 #### Blinded
 - A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
 - Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
 
 #### Charmed
 - A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
 - The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.
 
 #### Deafened
 - A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.
 
 #### Exhaustion
 
 Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.
 
 | Level | Effect                                         |
 |-------|------------------------------------------------|
 | 1     | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
 | 2     | Speed halved                                   |
 | 3     | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
 | 4     | Hit point maximum halved                       |
 | 5     | Speed reduced to 0                             |
 | 6     | Death                                          |
 
 If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
 
 A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.
 
 An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.
 
 Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.
 
 #### Frightened
 - A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
 - The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.
 
 #### Grappled
 - A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
 - The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
 - The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the *thunder-wave* spell.
 
 #### Incapacitated
 - An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.
