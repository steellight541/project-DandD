Elf

 ### Elf Traits
 
 Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.
 
 ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
 
 ***Age.*** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.
 
 ***Alignment.*** Elves love freedom, variety, and self- expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.
 
 ***Size.*** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
 
 ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
 
 ***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
 
 ***Keen Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
 
 ***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
 
 ***Trance.*** Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.
 
 After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
 
 ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
 
 #### High Elf
 
 As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.
 
 ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
 
 ***Elf Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.
 
 ***Cantrip.*** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
 
 ***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.
 
 Halfling
 --------
 
 ### Halfling Traits
 
 Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.
 
 ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
 
 ***Age.*** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.
 
 ***Alignment.*** Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.
 
 ***Size.*** Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
 
 ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
 
 ***Lucky.*** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
 
 ***Brave.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
 
 ***Halfling Nimbleness.*** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
 
 ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.
 
 #### Lightfoot
 
 As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others.
 
 Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life.
 
 ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 1.
 
 ***Naturally Stealthy.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.
 
 Human
 -----
 
 ### Human Traits
 
 It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.
 
 ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your ability scores each increase by 1.
 
 ***Age.*** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.
 
 ***Alignment.*** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.
 
 ***Size.*** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.
 
 ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
 
 ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects.
