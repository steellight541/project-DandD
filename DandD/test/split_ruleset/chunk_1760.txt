#### Holy Nimbus
 
 At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.
 
 Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.
 
 In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.
 
 Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
 
 ### Breaking Your Oath
 
 A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.
 
 A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.
 
 If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.

 ### Favored Enemy
 
 Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.
 
 Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.
 
 You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.
 
 When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.
 
 You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
 
 ### Natural Explorer
 
 You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.
 
 While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:
 - Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
 - Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
 - Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
 - If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
 - When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
