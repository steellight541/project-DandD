 #### Javelin of Lightning
 
 *Weapon (javelin), uncommon*
 
 This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.
 
 The javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.
 
 #### Lantern of Revealing
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern’s bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5- foot radius.
 
 #### Luck Blade
 
 *Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)*
 
 You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.
 
 ***Luck.*** If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 
 ***Wish.*** The sword has 1d4 – 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the *wish* spell from it. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.
 
 #### Mace of Disruption
 
 *Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)*
 
 When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
 
 While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
 
 #### Mace of Smiting
 
 *Weapon (mace), rare*
 
 You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the mace to attack a construct.
 
 When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage if it’s a construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.
 
 #### Mace of Terror
 
 *Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
 
 The mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
