 | Druid Level | Circle Spells                        |
 |-------------|--------------------------------------|
 | 3rd         | acid arrow, darkness                 |
 | 5th         | water walk, stinking cloud           |
 | 7th         | freedom of movement, locate creature |
 | 9th         | insect plague, scrying               |
 
 #### Land’s Stride
 
 Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
 
 In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell.
 
 #### Nature’s Ward
 
 When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.
 
 #### Nature’s Sanctuary
 
 When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
 
 The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.
 
 ### Sacred Plants and Wood
 
 A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.
 
 Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.
 
 Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.
 
 ### Druids and the Gods
 
 Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.
