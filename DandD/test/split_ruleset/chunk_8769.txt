 A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.
 
 You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.
 
 The hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.
 
 #### Magic Circle
 
 *3rd-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** 10 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.
 
 Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:
 - The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
 - The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
 - Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.
 
 When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.
 
 #### Magic Jar
 
 *6th-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)
 
 **Duration:** Until dispelled
 
 Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell’s material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.
 
 You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a *protection from evil and good* or *magic circle* spell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.
 
 Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.
 
 Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.
 
 While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.
 
 If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.
 
 When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.
 
 #### Magic Missile
 
 *1st-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.
 
 #### Magic Mouth
 
 *2nd-level illusion (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Until dispelled
 
 You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.
 
 When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.
 
 The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.
 
 #### Magic Weapon
 
 *2nd-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
