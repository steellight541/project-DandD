 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny reliquary worth at least 1,000 gp containing a sacred relic, such as a scrap of cloth from a saint’s robe or a piece of parchment from a religious text)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a 30-foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends.
 
 #### Hypnotic Pattern
 
 *3rd-level illusion*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** S, M (a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial filled with phosphorescent material)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.
 
 The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
 
 #### Ice Storm
 
 *4th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 300 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20- foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
 Hailstones turn the storm’s area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
 
 #### Identify
 
 *1st-level divination (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.
 
 If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.
 
 #### Illusory Script
 
 *1st-level illusion (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** S, M (a lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** 10 days
 
 You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.
 
 To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.
 
 Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.
 
 A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.
 
 #### Imprisonment
 
 *9th-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target)
 
 **Duration:** Until dispelled
 
 You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target.
 
 When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.
 
 ***Burial.*** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.
 
 The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.
 
 ***Chaining.*** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then.
