By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible omens:
 - *Weal*, for good results
 - *Woe*, for bad results
 - *Weal and woe*, for both good and bad results
 - *Nothing*, for results that aren’t especially good or bad
 
 The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
 
 If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.
 
 #### Awaken
 
 *5th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 8 hours
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human’s. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.
 
 The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.
 
 #### Bane
 
 *1st-level enchantment*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.
 
 ***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
 
 #### Banishment

 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.
 
 If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
 
 If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn’t return.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
