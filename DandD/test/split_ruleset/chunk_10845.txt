This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.
 
 #### True Strike
 
 *Divination cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round
 
 You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target’s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn’t ended.
 
 #### Unseen Servant
 
 *1st-level conjuration (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
 
 Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.
 
 If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.
 
 #### Vampiric Touch
 
 *3rd-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
 
 #### Wall of Fire
 
 *4th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.
 
 When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
 
 One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
 
 #### Wall of Force
 
 *5th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).
 
 Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by *dispel magic.* A *disintegrate* spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.
 
 #### Wall of Ice
 
 *6th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.
 
 If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
