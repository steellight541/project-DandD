 While wearing this cloak with its hood up, you can breathe underwater, and you have a swimming speed of 60 feet. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
 
 #### Crystal Ball
 
 *Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement)*
 
 The typical *crystal ball*, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the *scrying* spell (save DC 17) with it.
 
 The following *crystal ball* variants are legendary items and have additional properties.
 
 ***Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.*** You can use an action to cast the *detect thoughts* spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the *crystal ball*, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You don’t need to concentrate on this *detect thoughts* to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends.
 
 ***Crystal Ball of Telepathy.*** While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You can also use an action to cast the *suggestion* spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don’t need to concentrate on this *suggestion* to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends. Once used, the *suggestion* power of the *crystal ball* can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 
 ***Crystal Ball of True Seeing.*** While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell’s sensor.
 
 #### Cube of Force
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.
 
 You can use an action to press one of the cube’s faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube’s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier’s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.
 
 If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can’t pass through the cube, you can’t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.
 
 #### Cube of Force Faces
 
 | Face | Charges | Effect                                                                                                            |
 |------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | 1    | 1       | Gases, wind, and fog can’t pass through the barrier.                                                              |
 | 2    | 2       | Nonliving matter can’t pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion. |
 | 3    | 3       | Living matter can’t pass through the barrier.                                                                     |
 | 4    | 4       | Spell effects can’t pass through the barrier.                                                                     |
 | 5    | 5       | Nothing can pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.            |
 | 6    | 0       | The barrier deactivates.                                                                                          |
 
 The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the table below.
 
 | Spell or Item    | Charges Lost |
 |------------------|--------------|
 | Disintegrate     | 1d12         |
 | Horn of blasting | 1d10         |
 | Passwall         | 1d6          |
 | Prismatic spray  | 1d20         |
 | Wall of fire     | 1d4          |
 
 #### Cubic Gate
 
 *Wondrous item, legendary*
 
 This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.
 
 You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the *gate* spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the *plane shift* spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.
 
 The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
 
 #### Dagger of Venom
 
 *Weapon (dagger), rare*
 
 You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
 
 You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
 
 #### Dancing Sword
 
 *Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.
 
 While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.
 
 After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.
 
 #### Decanter of Endless Water
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.
 
 You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:
 - “Stream” produces 1 gallon of water.
 - “Fountain” produces 5 gallons of water.
 - “Geyser” produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn’t being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.
 
 #### Deck of Illusions
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards.
 
 The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.
 
 An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.
 
 The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can’t be used again.
