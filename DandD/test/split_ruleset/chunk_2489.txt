 At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.
 
 Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.
 
 ### Pact Boon
 
 At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.
 
 #### Pact of the Chain
 
 You learn the *find familiar* spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.
 
 When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
 
 Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.
 
 #### Pact of the Blade
 
 You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
 
 Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.
 
 You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.
 
 #### Pact of the Tome
 
 Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.
 
 If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.
 
 ### Ability Score Improvement
 
 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
 
 ### Mystic Arcanum
 
 At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.
 
 You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
 
 At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.
 
 ### Eldritch Master
 
 At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
 
 Eldritch Invocations
 --------------------
 
 If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.
 
 #### Agonizing Blast
 
 *Prerequisite:* eldritch blast *cantrip*
 
 When you cast *eldritch blast*, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.
 
 #### Armor of Shadows
 
 You can cast *mage armor* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.
 
 #### Ascendant Step
 
 *Prerequisite: 9th level*
 
 You can cast *levitate* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.
 
 #### Beast Speech
 
 You can cast *speak with animals* at will, without expending a spell slot.
 
 #### Beguiling Influence
 
 You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.
 
 #### Bewitching Whispers
 
 *Prerequisite: 7th level*
 
 You can cast *compulsion* once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
 
 #### Book of Ancient Secrets
 
 *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*
 
 You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.
 
 On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.
 
 #### Chains of Carceri
 
 *Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature*
 
 You can cast *hold monster* at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.
 
 #### Devil’s Sight
 
 You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.
 
 #### Dreadful Word
