Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.
 
 If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.
 
 #### Bag of Holding
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.
 
 If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.
 
 Placing a *bag of holding* inside an extradimensional space created by a *handy haversack*, *portable hole*, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.
 
 #### Bag of Tricks
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.
 
 You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag’s color.
 
 The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.
 
 Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn.

 #### Bead of Force
 
 *Wondrous item, rare*
 
 This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 *beads of force* are found together.
 
 You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.
 
 An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.
 
 #### Belt of Dwarvenkind
 
 *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits:
 - Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.
 - You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with dwarves.
 
 In addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50 percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard if you’re capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker beard if you already have one.
 
 If you aren’t a dwarf, you gain the following additional benefits while wearing the belt:
 - You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
 - You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
 - You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish.
 
 #### Belt of Giant Strength
 
 *Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the belt’s score, the item has no effect on you.
 
 Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The *belt of stone giant strength* and the *belt of frost giant strength* look different, but they have the same effect.
 
 | Type              | Strength | Rarity    |
 |-------------------|----------|-----------|
 | Hill giant        | 21       | Rare      |
