 **Actions**
 
 ***Multiattack.*** The captain makes three melee attacks: two with its scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two ranged attacks with its daggers.
 
 ***Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.
 
 ***Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 2)  piercing damage.
 
 **Reactions**
 
 ***Parry.*** The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
 
 It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The **bandit captain** has these qualities in spades.
 
 In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the **pirate captain** is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.
 
 More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain’s vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain’s colorful reputation.
