 *5th-level divination (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** 1 minute
 
 You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long- dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. A *greater restoration* spell cast on you ends this effect.
 
 On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.
 
 #### Contagion
 
 *5th-level necromancy*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Component:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** 7 days
 
 Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.
 
 At the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.
 
 Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.
 
 ***Blinding Sickness.*** Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.
 
 ***Filth Fever.*** A raging fever sweeps through the creature’s body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.
 
 ***Flesh Rot.*** The creature’s flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.
 
 ***Mindfire.*** The creature’s mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the *confusion* spell during combat.
 
 ***Seizure.*** The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.
 
 ***Slimy Doom.*** The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.
 
 #### Contingency
 
 *6th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)
 
 **Duration:** 10 days
 
 Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting *contingency*, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a *contingency* cast with *water breathing* might stipulate that *water breathing* comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
 
 The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then *contingency* ends.
 
 The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one *contingency* spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another *contingency* spell on you ends. Also, *contingency* ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.
 
 #### Continual Flame
 
 *2nd-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Touch
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Until dispelled
 
 A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A *continual flame* can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.
 
 #### Control Water
 
 *4th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 300 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
 
 Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.
 
 ***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.
 
 If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.
 
 The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.
 
 ***Part Water.*** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.
 
 ***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.
