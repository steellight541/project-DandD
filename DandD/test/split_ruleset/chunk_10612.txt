 *7th-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 10 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.
 
 The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.
 
 | Familiarity       | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |
 |-------------------|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
 | Permanent circle  | —      | —            | —          | 01–100    |
 | Associated object | —      | —            | —          | 01–100    |
 | Very familiar     | 01–05  | 06–13        | 14–24      | 25–100    |
 | Seen casually     | 01–33  | 34–43        | 44–53      | 54–100    |
 | Viewed once       | 01–43  | 44–53        | 54–73      | 74–100    |
 | Description       | 01–43  | 44–53        | 54–73      | 74–100    |
 | False destination | 01–50  | 51–100       | —          | —         |
 
 ***Familiarity.*** “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. “Associated object” means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb.
 
 “Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.
 
 “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.
 
 ***On Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.
 
 ***Off Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
 
 ***Similar Area.*** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
 
 ***Mishap.*** The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).
 
 #### Teleportation Circle
 
 *5th-level conjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 minute
 
 **Range:** 10 feet
 
 **Components:** V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** 1 round
 
 As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
 
 Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.
 
 You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.
 
 #### Thaumaturgy
 
 *Transmutation cantrip*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Up to 1 minute
 
 You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
 - Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.
 - You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
 - You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
 - You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
 - You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
 - You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
 
 #### Thunderwave
 
 *1st-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self (15-foot cube)
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.
 
 In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
 
 #### Time Stop
 
 *9th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
