This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with *oil of slipperiness.* When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.
 
 One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of *universal solvent* or *oil of etherealness*, or with a *wish* spell.
 
 #### Spell Scroll
 
 *Scroll, varies*
 
 A *spell scroll* bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell’s components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.
 
 If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.
 
 The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.
 
 ##### Spell Scroll
 
 | Spell Level | Rarity    | Save DC | Attack Bonus |
 |-------------|-----------|---------|--------------|
 | Cantrip     | Common    | 13      | +5           |
 | 1st         | Common    | 13      | +5           |
 | 2nd         | Uncommon  | 13      | +5           |
 | 3rd         | Uncommon  | 15      | +7           |
 | 4th         | Rare      | 15      | +7           |
 | 5th         | Rare      | 17      | +9           |
 | 6th         | Very rare | 17      | +9           |
 | 7th         | Very rare | 18      | +10          |
 | 8th         | Very rare | 18      | +10          |
 | 9th         | Legendary | 19      | +11          |
 
 A wizard spell on a *spell scroll* can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the *spell scroll* is destroyed.
 
 
 #### Spellguard Shield
 
 *Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks have disadvantage against you.
 
 #### Sphere of Annihilation
 
 *Wondrous item, legendary*
 
 This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.
 
 The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a *sphere of annihilation*, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.
 
 The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.
 
 If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature’s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.
 
 If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the *gate* spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a *portable hole*, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.
 
 | d100   | Result                                                                                                                             |
 |--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | 01–50  | The sphere is destroyed.                                                                                                           |
 | 51–85  | The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.                                                            |
 | 86–00  | A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence. |
 
 #### Staff of Charming
 
 *Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*
