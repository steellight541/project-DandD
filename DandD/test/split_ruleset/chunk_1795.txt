 ### Favored Enemy
 
 Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.
 
 Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.
 
 You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.
 
 When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.
 
 You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
 
 ### Natural Explorer
 
 You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.
 
 While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:
 - Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
 - Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
 - Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
 - If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
 - When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
 - While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.
 
 You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.
 
 ### Fighting Style
 
 At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
 
 #### Archery
 
 You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
 
 #### Defense
 
 While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
 
 #### Dueling
 
 When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
 
 #### Two-Weapon Fighting
 
 When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
 
 ### Spellcasting
 
 By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.
 
 #### Spell Slots
 
 The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
 
 For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot.
