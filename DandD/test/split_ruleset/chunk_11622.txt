The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:
 
 **Armor Class:** 20
 
 **Hit Points:** 200
 
 **Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren’t extended)
 
 **Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic
 
 To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.
 
 The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.
 
 A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.

 #### Armor, +1, +2, or +3
 
 *Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2), or legendary (+3)*
 
 You have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The bonus is determined by its rarity.
 
 #### Armor of Invulnerability
 
 *Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)*
 
 You have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this special action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 
 #### Armor of Resistance
 
 *Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires attunement)*
 
 You have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.
 
 | d10 | Damage Type |
 |-----|-------------|
 | 1   | Acid        |
 | 2   | Cold        |
 | 3   | Fire        |
 | 4   | Force       |
 | 5   | Lightning   |
 | 6   | Necrotic    |
 | 7   | Poison      |
 | 8   | Psychic     |
 | 9   | Radiant     |
 | 10  | Thunder     |
 
 #### Armor of Vulnerability
 
 *Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.
 
 ***Curse***. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an *identify* spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).
 
 #### Arrow-Catching Shield
 
 *Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)*
 
 You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
 
 #### Arrow of Slaying
 
 *Weapon (arrow), very rare*
 
 An *arrow of slaying* is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *arrows of dragon slaying* and *arrows of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an *arrow of slaying* takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.
 
 Once an *arrow of slaying* deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.
 
 Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as *bolts of slaying* meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.
 
 #### Bag of Beans
 
 *Wondrous item, rare*
 
 Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.
 
 If you dump the bag’s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
 
 If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.
 
 | d100  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

 | 01    | 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.                                                                                      |
 | 02–10 | A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
 | 11–20 | A treant sprouts. There’s a 50 percent chance that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
