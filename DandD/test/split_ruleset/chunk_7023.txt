**Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by *wall of force.*
 
 A creature targeted by this spell must make a
 
 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.
 
 A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.
 
 This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot- cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.
 
 #### Dispel Evil and Good
 
 *5th-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
 
 You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.
 
 ***Break Enchantment.*** As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.
 
 ***Dismissal.*** As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn’t there already). If they aren’t on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.
 
 #### Dispel Magic
 
 *3rd-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.
 
 #### Divination
 
 *4th-level divination (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god’s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.
 
 The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
 
 If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.
 
 #### Divine Favor
 
 *1st-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 Your prayer empowers you with divine radiance. Until the spell ends, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage on a hit.
 
 #### Divine Word
 
 *7th-level evocation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
 
 **Range:** 30 feet
 
 **Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:
 - 50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute
 - 40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes
 - 30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour
 - 20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn’t there already) and can’t return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a *wish* spell.
 
 #### Dominate Beast
