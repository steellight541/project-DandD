 ***Turning Immunity.*** The avatar is immune to features that turn undead.
 
 **Actions**
 
 ***Reaping Scythe.*** The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.
 
 ***Star.*** Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can’t exceed 24.
 
 ***Sun.*** You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.
 
 ***Talons.*** Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren’t destroyed but do vanish.
 
 ***Throne.*** You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.
 
 ***Vizier.*** At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.
 
 ***The Void.*** This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A *wish* spell can’t restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.
 
 #### Defender
 
 *Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)*
 
 You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
 
 The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.
 
 #### Demon Armor
 
 *Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor’s clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.
 
 ***Curse.*** Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t doff it unless you are targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
 
 #### Dimensional Shackles
 
 *Wondrous item, rare*
 
 You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.
 
 You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.
 
 #### Dragon Scale Mail
 
 *Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)*
 
 Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.
 
 While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).
 
 Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 
 | Dragon | Resistance |
 |--------|------------|
 | Black  | Acid       |
 | Blue   | Lightning  |
 | Brass  | Fire       |
 | Bronze | Lightning  |
 | Copper | Acid       |
 | Gold   | Fire       |
 | Green  | Poison     |
 | Red    | Fire       |
 | Silver | Cold       |
 | White  | Cold       |
 
 #### Dragon Slayer
 
 *Weapon (any sword), rare*
 
 You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
 
 When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon’s type. For the purpose of this weapon, “dragon” refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.
 
 #### Dust of Disappearance
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.
 
 #### Dust of Dryness
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.
 
 Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.
 
 An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
 #### Dust of Sneezing and Choking
 
 *Wondrous item, uncommon*
 
 Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be *dust of disappearance*, and an *identify* spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.
 
 When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The *lesser restoration* spell can also end the effect on a creature.
 
 #### Dwarven Plate
 
 *Armor (plate), very rare*
