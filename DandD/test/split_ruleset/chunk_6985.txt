**Components:** V
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as “200 feet straight downward” or “upward to the northwest at a 45- degree angle, 300 feet.”
 
 You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.
 
 If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.
 
 #### Disguise Self
 
 *1st-level illusion*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** 1 hour
 
 You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person— look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
 
 The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
 
 To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
 
 #### Disintegrate
 
 *6th-level transmutation*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 60 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by *wall of force.*
 
 A creature targeted by this spell must make a
 
 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.
 
 A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.
 
 This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot- cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.
 
 #### Dispel Evil and Good
 
 *5th-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)
 
 **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
 
 Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
 
 You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.
 
 ***Break Enchantment.*** As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.
 
 ***Dismissal.*** As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn’t there already). If they aren’t on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.
 
 #### Dispel Magic
 
 *3rd-level abjuration*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** 120 feet
 
 **Components:** V, S
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.
 
 ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.
 
 #### Divination
 
 *4th-level divination (ritual)*
 
 **Casting Time:** 1 action
 
 **Range:** Self
 
 **Components:** V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)
 
 **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
 Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god’s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.
